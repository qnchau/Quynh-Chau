```## Beer and Brewery Trends - Budweiser
## by Quynh Chau in collaboration with Antonio Debouse
## This is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Beer Styles and Breweries in the US done for the purposes of preparing 
## executive management at Budweiser for the organization's annual strategic planning.
## This EDA is to be used to inform executive leaderships on potential market expansions to be considered in the company's
## strategic plan
## A reference list of data sources and assumptions included in the EDA for the purposes of data validation and also updating trending
## purposes in future years.
## Statistical analysis will be done using R.

## The following R libraries are needed for analytical purposes
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(class)
library(caret)
library(stringr)
library(DataExplorer)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lattice)
library(knitr)
library(corrplot)


### The following section reads the Breweries data file containing information breweries by US states, and quantifies missing values

Breweries = read.csv("C:/Users/Owner/Documents/SMU/Doing Data Sci/Unit 8 & 9/Breweries.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
str(Breweries)
dim(Breweries)
plot_missing(Breweries)
summary(Breweries)
Tot_Brew <- Breweries %>% group_by(State) %>% summarise(Tot_Breweries = n_distinct(Name, na.rm = TRUE)) # this code counts the number of breweries by state
Sum_Brew = data.frame(Tot_Brew)
str(Sum_Brew)
arrange(Sum_Brew,desc(Tot_Breweries))                                   
SumBrew %>% ggplot(aes(x = State, y = Tot_Breweries, color = State, fill = State, label = Tot_Breweries)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  labs(title = "Number of Breweries by State") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

## There are 558 breweries by brewery ID, name,city, and state (4 columns) in this data file
## Question 1.  Colorado (CO): 46, California(CA): 39, Michigan (MI): 32, Oregon (OR):29 and Texas (TX): 28 are the states with the highest number of breweries, respectively

### The following section reads data files containing information on Beer Bitterness, Alcohol Content, and Breweries by State

Beers = read.csv("C:/Users/Owner/Documents/SMU/Doing Data Sci/Unit 8 & 9/Beers.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
str(Beers)
dim(Beers)
plot_missing(Beers)
summary(Beers)

## Beers has 2,410 rows and 7 columns; Alcoholic Content (ABV) has 62 missing values; Beeer Bitterness (IBU) has 1,005 missing values
## These values will be omitted in specific analyses.

### Merge Beerand Breweries Data using unique Brewery ID and full join
## Question 2:  Merge and check beer and breweries data by reviewing first 6 (head) and last six (tail) observations of merged file
## Renames joined columns with Beer_Name and Brewery_Name so that they are descriptive 

AllAboutBeer <- full_join(Beers,Breweries,by =c("Brewery_id" = "Brew_ID"))  
str(AllAboutBeer)                                         
head(AllAboutBeer)
tail(AllAboutBeer)
names(AllAboutBeer)[names(AllAboutBeer)=="Name.x"] <- "Beer_Name"
names(AllAboutBeer)[names(AllAboutBeer)=="Name.y"] <- "Brewery_Name"
str(AllAboutBeer)

### Question 3. Check for missing values, which will be excluded depending in specific analyses using na.rm/drop.na/na.omit as appropriate

plot_missing(AllAboutBeer)

## Question 3. IBU seems to have the most missing values at 41.7% and ABV at 2.57%.  These rows will be omitted or deleted during specific analyses

### Question 4.  Compute the median alcohol content (ABV) amnd international bitterness (IBU) and plot using bar charts to compare
## rename merged columns to more descriptive names

Medians <- AllAboutBeer %>% group_by(State) %>% summarise(count = n(), median_ABV= median(ABV,na.rm = TRUE),
           median_IBU = median(IBU,na.rm = TRUE))
arrange(Medians,desc(median_ABV))
arrange(Medians,desc(median_IBU))

Medians %>% drop_na() %>% ggplot(aes(x = State, y = median_ABV)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "dark green") + 
  labs(title = "Beer Alcoholic Content by State") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
Medians %>% drop_na() %>% ggplot(aes(x = State, y = median_IBU)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "red") + 
  labs(title = "Beer Bitterness by State") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
Medians[which.max(Medians$median_ABV),]
Medians[which.max(Medians$median_IBU),]

## Maine has the most bitter beer; District of Columbia (DC) the most alcoholic content in beers as measured by median values by state

### Question 5. States with maximum alcoholic beer and state with the most bitter beer

AllAboutBeer[which.max(AllAboutBeer$ABV),]  
AllAboutBeer[which.max(AllAboutBeer$IBU),]

## Boulder, Colorado has the beer with the highest alcohol content - Lee Hill Series Vol. 5 - Belgian Style Quadrupel Ale, produced by
## the Upslope Brewing Company
## Astoria, Oregon produces the most bitter beer - Bitter Bitch Imperial IPA by the Astoria Brewing Company

### This section describes the relationship between ABV and IBU using the AllAboutBeer merged data set
## Question 6 Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable

summary(AllAboutBeer$ABV,digits = 3)
AllAboutBeer %>% drop_na() %>% ggplot(aes(y=ABV)) + geom_boxplot(fill = "Red") + ggtitle("Beer Alcohol Content")
AllAboutBeer %>% drop_na() %>% ggplot(aes(y=IBU)) + geom_boxplot(fill = "Blue")+ ggtitle("Beer Bitterness")
AllAboutBeer %>% drop_na() %>% ggplot(aes(x=ABV)) + geom_histogram(fill = "Red") + ggtitle("Beer Alcohol Content")

##Beer Alcohol content is right skewed.  This is supported by the wide range of ABV from 0.01 to 0.128 and the mean (0.0598)
##being greater than the median (0.056)

###The following section explores the relationship between beer alcohol content (ABV) and beer bitterness (IBU)
## Question 7. Describe the relationship between ABV and IBU, provide scatterplot

AllAboutBeer %>% drop_na() %>% ggplot(aes(x=ABV, y=IBU)) + geom_point(color="blue")+ geom_smooth(se=FALSE, color = "red")+
  ggtitle("ABV and IBU Covariation Analysis")
  
ABV_IBU <- AllAboutBeer[,c(3,4)]
ABV_IBU = na.omit(ABV_IBU)
plot_correlation(ABV_IBU, type = 'continuous','Review.Date')

## There is a strong correlation between beer bittnerness and alcohol content - correlation coefficient of 0.67.  The graph
## of covariation between IBU and ABV suggests that the higher the beer bitterness, the higher the alcohol content.

###This section focuses on ales : India Pale Ales (IPA) and other types of ales (Non-IPAs) using knn classifications
## Question 8 Budweiser would like to investigate the difference between IPAs and nonIPAs

All_Ale <- filter(AllAboutBeer, grepl("Ale", Style))
Only_Ale <- filter(All_Ale, !grepl("IPA",Style))
Only_Ale$Style = "Ale"

IPA <- filter(AllAboutBeer, grepl("IPA",Style))
IPA$Style = "IPA"

IPA_and_Only_Ale_Comb <- rbind(IPA,Only_Ale)
str(IPA_and_Only_Ale_Comb)
summary(IPA_and_Only_Ale_Comb)

#Plot relationship between IBU and AVV
IPA_and_Only_Ale_Comb %>% ggplot(aes(x=ABV, y=IBU, color= Style))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(aes(linetype = Style),color="Black",se=FALSE)

#Delete all missing observations
CleanData_IPA_and_Ale <- na.omit(IPA_and_Only_Ale_Comb)

#Change Style to a factor variable
CleanData_IPA_and_Ale$Style = factor(CleanData_IPA_and_Ale$Style)

#Internal cross Validation, unstandardized with k=3
classifications = knn.cv(CleanData_IPA_and_Ale[,c(3,4)], CleanData_IPA_and_Ale$Style, k = 3)
data.frame(classifications = classifications, true = CleanData_IPA_and_Ale$Style)
confusionMatrix(classifications,CleanData_IPA_and_Ale$Style)

#Internal cross Validation, standardized with k = 3
Standard_CleanData_IPA_and_Ale <- data.frame(ZABV = scale(CleanData_IPA_and_Ale$ABV),
                                             ZIBU = scale(CleanData_IPA_and_Ale$IBU), 
                                             Style = CleanData_IPA_and_Ale$Style)

classifications = knn.cv(Standard_CleanData_IPA_and_Ale[,c(1,2)],Standard_CleanData_IPA_and_Ale$Style, k=3)
confusionMatrix(classifications,Standard_CleanData_IPA_and_Ale$Style)

## There is a positive correlation between ABV and IBU for all beer styles.  In particular to Ales - between IPAs and
## non-IPA ales, IPAs tend to have higher IBU and ABV.  This distinction is supported by the high accuracy of prediction
## for IPAs and non-IPA ales using KNN classification modeling with IBU and ABV with 86% accuracy rate.

### This section combines beer styles, breweries, median household income from US Census Bureau, and beer consumption via gallons consumed per capita per state region
##  Question 9  Use combined demographics data to make an recommendation on which US region should be targeted for expansion for ales

BeerDemo = read.csv("C:/Users/Owner/Documents/SMU/Doing Data Sci/Unit 8 & 9/BeerDemo.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
BeerDemo$St_Abbrev = as.character(BeerDemo$St_Abbrev)
str(BeerDemo)

## Merge demographics with ales data
CleanData_IPA_and_Ale$State = as.character(CleanData_IPA_and_Ale$State)
AlesDemo <- merge(CleanData_IPA_and_Ale,BeerDemo, by=NULL)
head(AlesDemo)
tail(AlesDemo)

AleRegion <- select(AlesDemo,ABV, IBU,Style,Region,Beer_Consump,MedHHIncome,Income_Rank)
##Plot correlation matrix for ales with demographics
plot_correlation(drop_na(AleRegion), type = "all",'Review.Date')

## The correlation Ales plot shows a positive .25 correlation between the Midwest region and beer consumption. This ## represents a potential underserved market for Budweiser's consideration to expand in the ales consumer market.
